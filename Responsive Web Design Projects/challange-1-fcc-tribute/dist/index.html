          <section><h3>Biography</h3>
            <p>Bhagat Singh was an Indian revolutionary who played a pivotal role in the Indian Independence movement against British colonial rule. Born into a family of patriotic Sikhs well-known for their participation in revolutionary activities against the British Raj, he was inspired greatly by the courage of his father and uncles.</p> <p>As a young man he became attracted to anarchist and Marxist ideologies which further kindled revolutionary ideas in his mind. Bright and intelligent he was also an avid reader and actively participated in extra-curricular activities as a college student.He was involved with several revolutionary organizations including the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), which changed its name to the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) in 1928. <p>He had great respect for Lala Lajpat Rai who was injured in a protest against the Simon Commission. When Rai died a few days later, Singh decided to avenge his death and assassinated John Saunders, a British police officer. Evading arrest, he went on to throw bombs inside the Central Legislative Assembly and then offered himself for arrest. He garnered tremendous support from other patriots while in jail and his execution boosted the revolutionariesâ€™ determination to continue fighting for independence.He was also criticized for his violent stance towards the British but that did not prevent him from becoming a legend of the Indian independence movement.</p>
