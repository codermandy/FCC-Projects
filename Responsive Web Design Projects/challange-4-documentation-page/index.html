            <header id="intoduction">Introduction to Javascript</header>
            <p>JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language. It is designed for creating
                network-centric applications. It is complimentary to and integrated with Java. JavaScript is very easy
                to implement because it is integrated with html. It is open and cross-platform.</p>
            <p>Javascript is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially
                when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning
                Javascript:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Javascript is the most popular programming language in the world and that makes it a programmer’s
                    great choice. Once you learnt Javascript, it helps you developing great front-end as well as
                    back-end softwares using different Javascript based frameworks like jQuery, Node.JS etc.</li>
                <li>Javascript is everywhere, it comes installed on every modern web browser and so to learn Javascript
                    you really do not need any special environment setup. For example Chrome, Mozilla Firefox , Safari
                    and every browser you know as of today, supports Javascript.</li>
                <li>Javascript helps you create really beautiful and crazy fast websites. You can develop your website
                    with a console like look and feel and give your users the best Graphical User Experience.</li>
                <li>
                    JavaScript usage has now extended to mobile app development, desktop app development, and game
                    development. This opens many opportunities for you as Javascript Programmer.
                </li>
                <li>Due to high demand, there is tons of job growth and high pay for those who know JavaScript. You can
                    navigate over to different job sites to see what having JavaScript skills looks like in the job
                    market.</li>
                <li>Great thing about Javascript is that you will find tons of frameworks and Libraries already
                    developed which can be used directly in your software development to reduce your time to market.
                </li>
                <p>There could be 1000s of good reasons to learn Javascript Programming. But one thing for sure, to
                    learn any programming language, not only Javascript, you just need to code, and code and finally
                    code until you become expert.</p>

            </ul>

        <section class="main-section" id="variables">
            <header id="variables">Javascript Variables</header>
            <p>JavaScript can be implemented using JavaScript statements that are placed within the &lt;script&gt; ...
                &lt;script&gt; HTML tags in a web page.

                You can place the &lt;script&gt; tags, containing your JavaScript, anywhere within your web page, but it
                is normally recommended that you should keep it within the &lt;head&gt; tags.

                The &lt;script&gt; tag alerts the browser program to start interpreting all the text between these tags
                as a script. A simple syntax of your JavaScript will appear as follows.</p>
            <code>
                    &lt;script ...&gt;<br>
                    JavaScript code<br>
                 &lt;/script&gt;<br>
                 </code>
            </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="functions">
            <header id="functions">Javascript Functions</header>
            <p>A function is a group of reusable code which can be called anywhere in your program. This eliminates the
                need of writing the same code again and again. It helps programmers in writing modular codes. Functions
                allow a programmer to divide a big program into a number of small and manageable functions.

                Like any other advanced programming language, JavaScript also supports all the features necessary to
                write modular code using functions. You must have seen functions like alert() and write() in the earlier
                chapters. We were using these functions again and again, but they had been written in core JavaScript
                only once.</p>
