            <p>JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language. It is designed for creating
                network-centric applications. It is complimentary to and integrated with Java. JavaScript is very easy
                to implement because it is integrated with html. It is open and cross-platform.</p>
            <p>Javascript is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially
                when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning
                Javascript:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Javascript is the most popular programming language in the world and that makes it a programmer’s
                    great choice. Once you learnt Javascript, it helps you developing great front-end as well as
                    back-end softwares using different Javascript based frameworks like jQuery, Node.JS etc.</li>
                <li>Javascript is everywhere, it comes installed on every modern web browser and so to learn Javascript
                    you really do not need any special environment setup. For example Chrome, Mozilla Firefox , Safari
                    and every browser you know as of today, supports Javascript.</li>
                <li>Javascript helps you create really beautiful and crazy fast websites. You can develop your website
                    with a console like look and feel and give your users the best Graphical User Experience.</li>
                <li>
                    JavaScript usage has now extended to mobile app development, desktop app development, and game
                    development. This opens many opportunities for you as Javascript Programmer.
                </li>
                <li>Due to high demand, there is tons of job growth and high pay for those who know JavaScript. You can
                    navigate over to different job sites to see what having JavaScript skills looks like in the job
                    market.</li>
                <li>Great thing about Javascript is that you will find tons of frameworks and Libraries already
                    developed which can be used directly in your software development to reduce your time to market.
                </li>
                <p>There could be 1000s of good reasons to learn Javascript Programming. But one thing for sure, to
                    learn any programming language, not only Javascript, you just need to code, and code and finally
                    code until you become expert.</p>

            </ul>

            <header id="javascript_variables">Javascript Variables</header>
            <p>JavaScript can be implemented using JavaScript statements that are placed within the &lt;script&gt; ...
                &lt;script&gt; HTML tags in a web page.

                You can place the &lt;script&gt; tags, containing your JavaScript, anywhere within your web page, but it
                is normally recommended that you should keep it within the &lt;head&gt; tags.

                The &lt;script&gt; tag alerts the browser program to start interpreting all the text between these tags
                as a script. A simple syntax of your JavaScript will appear as follows.</p>
            <code>
                    &lt;script ...&gt;<br>
                    JavaScript code<br>
                 &lt;/script&gt;<br>
                 </code>
            </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="javascript_functions">
            <header id="javascript_functions">Javascript Functions</header>
            <p>A function is a group of reusable code which can be called anywhere in your program. This eliminates the
                need of writing the same code again and again. It helps programmers in writing modular codes. Functions
                allow a programmer to divide a big program into a number of small and manageable functions.

                Like any other advanced programming language, JavaScript also supports all the features necessary to
                write modular code using functions. You must have seen functions like alert() and write() in the earlier
                chapters. We were using these functions again and again, but they had been written in core JavaScript
                only once.</p>

            <p> JavaScript is an Object Oriented Programming (OOP) language. A programming language can be called

                    Oriented Programming (OOP) language. A programming language can be called object-oriented if it
                    provides four basic capabilities to developers −</p>>
                <ul>


                    <li> <strong>Encapsulation</strong> − the capability to store related information, whether data or
                        methods, together in an object.</li>

                    <li><strong>Aggregation</strong> − the capability to store one object inside another object.</li>

                    <li><strong>Inheritance</strong> − the capability of a class to rely upon another class (or number
                        of classes) for some of its properties and methods.</li>

                    <li><strong>Polymorphism</strong> − the capability to write one function or method that works in a
                        variety of different ways.</li>

                </ul>
                <p>Objects are composed of attributes. If an attribute contains a function, it is considered to be a
                    method of the object, otherwise the attribute is considered a property.</p>
                <p>Object properties can be any of the three primitive data types, or any of the abstract data types,
                    such as another object. Object properties are usually variables that are used internally in the
                    object's methods, but can also be globally visible variables that are used throughout the page.
                    The syntax for adding a property to an object is −

                    <br><code>objectName.objectProperty = propertyValue;</code>
                    <p>Methods are the functions that let the object do something or let something be done to it. There
                        is a small difference between a function and a method – at a function is a standalone unit of
                        statements and a method is attached to an object and can be referenced by the this keyword.

                        Methods are useful for everything from displaying the contents of the object to the screen to
                        performing complex mathematical operations on a group of local properties and parameters.

                        For example − Following is a simple example to show how to use the write() method of document
                        object to write any content on the document.
                        <br>
                        <code>document.write("This is test");</code>
                    </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="javascript_strings">
            <header id="javascript_strings">Javascript Strings</header>
            <p>The String object lets you work with a series of characters; it wraps Javascript's string primitive data
                type with a number of helper methods.

                As JavaScript automatically converts between string primitives and String objects, you can call any of
                the helper methods of the String object on a string primitive.</p>

        <p>
            Use the following syntax to create a String object −
<br>
<code>val = new String(string);</code>
<br>
The String parameter is a series of characters that has been properly encoded.

        <section class="main-section" id="javascript_arrays">
            <header id="javascript_arrays">Javascript Arrays</header>
            <p> Array object lets you store multiple values in a single variable. It stores a fixed-size sequential
            collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often
            more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.
            </p>
<p>Use the following syntax to create an Array object −

    <br><code> fruits = new Array( "apple", "orange", "mango" );</code><br>
    
    The Array parameter is a list of strings or integers. When you specify a single numeric parameter with the Array constructor, you specify the initial length of the array. The maximum length allowed for an array is 4,294,967,295.
    
    You can create array by simply assigning values as follows −
    
<code> var fruits = [ "apple", "orange", "mango" ];</code>
    
    You will use ordinal numbers to access and to set values inside an array as follows.
    <br>
    <code>fruits[0] is the first element
    fruits[1] is the second element
    fruits[2] is the third element</code>
    </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="regular_expressions">
            <header id="regular_expressions">Regular Expressions</header>
            A regular expression is an object that describes a pattern of characters.

            The JavaScript RegExp class represents regular expressions, and both String and RegExp define methods that
            use regular expressions to perform powerful pattern-matching and search-and-replace functions on text.
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="html_dom">
            <header id="html_dom">HTML DOM</header>
            <p>Every web page resides inside a browser window which can be considered as an object.

                A Document object represents the HTML document that is displayed in that window. The Document object has
                various properties that refer to other objects which allow access to and modification of document
                content.

                The way a document content is accessed and modified is called the Document Object Model, or DOM. The
                Objects are organized in a hierarchy. This hierarchical structure applies to the organization of objects
                in a Web document.</p>
